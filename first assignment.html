    <h1>Kerala Cyber Police nab Parivahan app fraud gang from Varanasi, 16-year-old among accused..</h1>

    <p>

The Parivarthan App fraud case is a recent and serious example of cybercrime in India. In this case, a fake mobile application named Parivarthan was developed and circulated, mainly targeting people in Kerala. The app was presented as a government scheme offering financial aid and job opportunities. Many people believed it was a genuine government initiative and downloaded it on their phones.

Once installed, the app requested users to enter personal and sensitive information, such as their full name, Aadhaar number, bank account details, and even OTPs. The information collected through the app was misused by the fraudsters to access victims' bank accounts and carry out unauthorized transactions. As a result, several people lost money and reported the incident to the Kerala Cyber Police.

The Cyber Police took immediate action and began a technical investigation. By tracing the app’s server location, payment trails, and IP addresses, they discovered that the scam was being operated from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. A special team was sent there, and with the support of local police, the gang behind the fraud was arrested.

One shocking detail in this case was that a 16-year-old boy was among the accused. He was found to be the main technical expert in the group who developed and maintained the app. This raised concerns about how even minors are now getting involved in cybercrime due to their digital skills and access to the internet.

After arresting the gang, the police brought the accused to Kerala for further questioning. They also warned the public not to download apps from unknown sources and to verify the authenticity of apps before providing personal details. Citizens were also advised to report any cyber-related complaints to the national cybercrime portal or the helpline number 1930.

This case highlights the importance of cyber safety and awareness in today's digital world. It also shows the challenges faced by law enforcement in tracking and controlling online fraud, especially when the crimes are committed across state borders. Overall, the Parivarthan App case is a reminder that people must be careful while using technology, and authorities must strengthen cybercrime monitoring and education</p>

Neeraj Chopra, India’s golden boy in athletics, once again made the country proud by winning the gold medal in the javelin throw event at the Asian Athletics Championship. His exceptional performance has not only added another feather to his cap but also brought glory to Indian sports on an international level.

Neeraj, who has already achieved worldwide recognition after winning gold at the Tokyo Olympics, maintained his reputation with a powerful throw that none of the other competitors could match. His training, focus, and determination were clearly visible in the way he dominated the event. The crowd applauded as he made his throw, and the moment was celebrated across India through news, social media, and sports networks.

His success is the result of years of hard work, disciplined practice, and a strong mental attitude. Neeraj has become an inspiration for thousands of young athletes in India who now believe that they too can reach the top in athletics, especially in a field event like javelin, which was not very popular in the country earlier.

This victory also highlights the growth of athletics in India and the efforts made by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and various coaching academies to support and promote talented athletes. With each international achievement, Neeraj is helping to bring more attention to Indian track and field sports, which have long been in the shadow of cricket.

In conclusion, Neeraj Chopra’s gold medal at the Asian Athletics Championship is not just a personal victory, but a national celebration. It proves that with the right guidance and determination, Indian athletes can shine at the highest levels. His story motivates the next generation to dream big and aim for international success in sports.
